Incubyte TDD Assessment

Things To Keep In Mind
Host your solution on a public GitHub/GitLab repository.
Follow best practices for TDD. Watch this video to understand TDD better.
Commit your changes frequently, ideally after every change to show how your code evolves with every step of TDD.
We encourage you to use the programming language and tools you feel most comfortable with. 
If you are applying for a specific role, you might want to use the language that is most relevant to the role.
Do not rush, take your time. We want to see your best work!
Send us the link to your repo once youâ€™re happy with what you have done.
